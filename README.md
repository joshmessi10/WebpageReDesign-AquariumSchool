# 🎨 Aquarium School – Website Redesign

This was my **first web design project**, where I reimagined and redesigned an existing website called **Aquarium School**. The goal was to improve the site's visual layout, responsiveness, and user experience using modern HTML and CSS practices.

## 🧠 Project Highlights

- ✅ Redesigned the UI for better clarity, spacing, and visual appeal.
- ✅ Improved layout structure using semantic HTML.
- ✅ Applied custom styling for a clean and modern look.
- ✅ Focused on accessibility and responsive design.
